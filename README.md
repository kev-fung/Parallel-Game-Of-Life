# Conway's Game of Life Parallelised

A cellular automaton program, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life, which has been implemented with C++ and the Message Passing Interface for computational optimisation. Users may specify the domain size, time simulation, and number of computational cores for parallelisation.
Software developed for the ACSE course.

## How to run
1. Set up simulation parameters in Main.cpp
2. Run mpiexec in ./Debug/Assignment3.exe
3. Run Jupyter Notebook in ./Debug and open visualisation.ipynb

**NB: Game of life output folder should be in the same location as the notebook!**
